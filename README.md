# Extended-basis-encoding-and-amplitude-encoding-algorithms-for-Qiskit
These are implementations for quantum basis encoding and amplitude encoding using Qiskit. 

1.  Download the individual .ipynb files from the 'Release' on the right. Just click on the files to start downloading.

2.  Run these files as a notebook file in jupyter notebook after setting up Qiskit. 
    To get results for more than 5 qubits on simulated systems, comment out all references to job3 and counts3.

3.  In the extended basis encoding project, you can change the variable 'data' according to the rules in the comments. 

4.  In the amplitude encoding project, you can change the variable 'data_length', and 'data_points' either by using the test functions or manually.
